# JavaScript Development with modern Technologies

<br/>

Hello, I am Marley (nicname) and I am from Russia!<br/>
Here I am planning collect materials, that can help me in my JS projects.<br/>
If you are interesting in JS and JS frameworks you can join to our <a href="/chat/">telegram group</a> and share good code examples that can be helpful for everyone.

I think it is much convenient to work with [downloaded](https://github.com/webmakaka/jsdev.org) version of website. I know, that for now it is looks like garbage, but i am working to clean it.

<br/>

For now i am watching interesting for me video course [Zero to Mastery] Complete Angular Developer in 2023 [ENG, 2022]

<a href="https://complete-angular-developer.jsdev.org/">Here is current deployed app</a>

And here is <a href="https://github.com/webmakaka/Complete-Angular-Developer">Source codes</a>

If you have some question, ask in the chat.
